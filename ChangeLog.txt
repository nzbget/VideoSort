videosort-3.0:
  - added for seasoned TV shows: if year in the file name goes directly after
    show name, it will be added to show name. This may be necessary for
    media players like XBMC, Boxee or Plex (or anyone using TheTVDB) to
    properly index TV show. New option option "SeriesYear";

    a nzb-name is used instead.

  - added support for DNZB-Header "X-DNZB-UseNZBName";
